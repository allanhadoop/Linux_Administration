based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) , linux directory tree is divided into separate filesystems with different purposes 
The major parts are the root (/ ), /usr , /var , and /home filesystems
Figure 3.1 at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#INTRO

1. root Filesystem 
2. /usr Filesystem 
3. /var Filesystem
4. /home Filesystem

1. root(/) Filesystem - 
This is specific for each machine (it is generally stored on a local disk, although it could be a ramdisk or network drive as well) and 
contains the files that are necessary for booting the system up, and to bring it up to such a state that the other filesystems may be 
mounted. The contents of the root filesystem will therefore be sufficient for the single user state.	It will also contain tools for 
fixing a broken system, and for recovering lost files from backups.
It contains - 

/bin  - This folder contains commands needed during bootup that might be used by normal users (probably after bootup).

/sbin - Like /bin, but the commands are not intended for normal users, although they may use them if necessary and allowed. 

/etc - Configuration files specific to the machine.

/root - The home directory for user root. This is usually not accessible to other users on the system

/lib - Shared libraries needed by the programs on the root filesystem

/lib/modules - Loadable kernel modules, especially those that are needed to boot the system when recovering from disasters (e.g., network and filesystem drivers).

/dev - Device files. These are special files that help the user interface with the various devices on the system.

/tmp - Temporary files. As the name suggests, programs running often store temporary files in here 

/mnt - Mount point for temporary mounts by the system administrator. Programs aren't supposed to mount on /mnt automatically. /mnt might 
be divided into subdirectories (e.g., /mnt/dosa might be the floppy drive using an MS-DOS filesystem, and /mnt/exta might be the same 
with an ext2 filesystem).

/proc, /usr, /var, /home - Mount points for the other filesystems.

/boot - Files used by the bootstrap loader, e.g., LILO or GRUB. Kernel images are often kept here instead of in the root directory. If 
there are many kernel images, the directory can easily grow rather big, and it might be better to keep it in a separate filesystem. 
Another reason would be to make sure the kernel images are within the first 1024 cylinders of an IDE disk. This 1024 cylinder limit is 
no longer true in most cases. With modern BIOSes and later versions of LILO (the LInux LOader) the 1024 cylinder limit can be passed 
with logical block addressing (LBA)

------
2. /usr Filesystem - 
The /usr filesystem contains all commands, libraries, manual pages, and other unchanging files needed during normal operation. No files 
in /usr should be specific for any given machine, nor should they be modified during normal use. This allows the files to be shared over 
the network, which can be cost-effective since it saves disk space (there can easily be hundreds of megabytes, increasingly multiple 
gigabytes in /usr). It can make administration easier (only the master /usr needs to be changed when updating an application, not each 
machine separately) to have /usr network mounted. Even if the filesystem is on a local disk, it could be mounted read-only, to lessen the 
chance of filesystem corruption during a crash

3. /var Filesystem -
The /var filesystem contains files that change, such as spool directories (for mail, news, printers, etc), log files, formatted manual 
pages, and temporary files. Traditionally everything in /var has been somewhere below /usr , but that made it impossible to mount /usr 
read-only.

4. /home Filesystem -
The /home filesystem contains the users' home directories, i.e., all the real data on the system. Separating home directories to their 
own directory tree or filesystem makes backups easier; the other parts often do not have to be backed up, or at least not as often as 
they seldom change. A big /home might have to be broken across several filesystems, which requires adding an extra naming level below 
/home, for example /home/students and /home/staff.

-------------
* The /etc directory - 
/etc/rc or /etc/rc.d or /etc/rc?.d  -- Scripts or directories of scripts to run at startup or when changing the run level.
/etc/passwd  - The user database, with fields giving the username, real name, home directory, and other information about each user.
/etc/shadow  - encrypted file the holds user passwords 
/etc/group   - Similar to /etc/passwd, but describes groups instead of users

/etc/magic   - The configuration file for file. Contains the descriptions of various file formats based on which file guesses the type of the file.
/etc/inittab - Configuration file for init.
/etc/issue   - Output by getty before login prompt.Usually contains a short description or welcoming message to the system
/etc/motd    - The message of the day, automatically output after a successful login
/etc/mtab    - List of currently mounted filesystems. Initially set up by the bootup scripts, and updated automatically by the mount 
command. Used when a list of mounted filesystems is needed, e.g., by the df command

/etc/login.defs - Configuration file for the login command
/etc/profile, /etc/bash.rc, /etc/csh.cshrc  - Files executed at login or startup time by the Bourne, BASH , or C shells. These allow 
the system administrator to set global defaults for all users.
/etc/securetty  - Identifies secure terminals, i.e., the terminals from which root is allowed to log in. Typically only the virtual 
consoles are listed, so that it becomes impossible (or at least harder) to gain superuser privileges by breaking into a system over a 
modem or a network. Do not allow root logins over a network.
/etc/shells  - Lists trusted shells. The chsh command allows users to change their login shell only to shells listed in this file. 
ftpd, is the server process that provides FTP services for a machine, will check that the user's shell is listed in /etc/shells and 
will not let people log in unless the shell is listed there.
