based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) , linux directory tree is divided into separate filesystems with different purposes 
The major parts are the root (/ ), /usr , /var , and /home filesystems

1. root Filesystem 
2. /usr Filesystem 
3. /var Filesystem
4. /home Filesystem

1. root(/) Filesystem - 
This is specific for each machine (it is generally stored on a local disk, although it could be a ramdisk or network drive as well) and 
contains the files that are necessary for booting the system up, and to bring it up to such a state that the other filesystems may be 
mounted. The contents of the root filesystem will therefore be sufficient for the single user state.	It will also contain tools for 
fixing a broken system, and for recovering lost files from backups.
It contains - 
/bin  - 
/sbin - 
/etc - 
/root - 
/lib - 
/lib/modules - 
/dev -
/tmp - 
/boot -
/mnt - 
/proc, /usr, /var, /home - 


2. /usr Filesystem - 
The /usr filesystem contains all commands, libraries, manual pages, and other unchanging files needed during normal operation. No files 
in /usr should be specific for any given machine, nor should they be modified during normal use. This allows the files to be shared over 
the network, which can be cost-effective since it saves disk space (there can easily be hundreds of megabytes, increasingly multiple 
gigabytes in /usr). It can make administration easier (only the master /usr needs to be changed when updating an application, not each 
machine separately) to have /usr network mounted. Even if the filesystem is on a local disk, it could be mounted read-only, to lessen the 
chance of filesystem corruption during a crash

3. /var Filesystem -
The /var filesystem contains files that change, such as spool directories (for mail, news, printers, etc), log files, formatted manual 
pages, and temporary files. Traditionally everything in /var has been somewhere below /usr , but that made it impossible to mount /usr 
read-only.

4. /home Filesystem -
The /home filesystem contains the users' home directories, i.e., all the real data on the system. Separating home directories to their 
own directory tree or filesystem makes backups easier; the other parts often do not have to be backed up, or at least not as often as 
they seldom change. A big /home might have to be broken across several filesystems, which requires adding an extra naming level below 
/home, for example /home/students and /home/staff.
