based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) , linux directory tree is divided into separate filesystems with different purposes 
The major parts are the root (/ ), /usr , /var , and /home filesystems
Figure 3.1 at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#INTRO

1. root Filesystem 
2. /usr Filesystem 
3. /var Filesystem
4. /home Filesystem

1. root Filesystem - 
This is specific for each machine (it is generally stored on a local disk, although it could be a ramdisk or network drive as well) and 
contains the files that are necessary for booting the system up, and to bring it up to such a state that the other filesystems may be 
mounted. The contents of the root filesystem will therefore be sufficient for the single user state.	It will also contain tools for 
fixing a broken system, and for recovering lost files from backups.

2. /usr Filesystem
