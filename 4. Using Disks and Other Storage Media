When you install or upgrade your system, you need to do a fair amount of work on your disks. You have to make filesystems on your disks so
that files can be stored on them and reserve space for the different parts of your system

--------------------------The basic tasks in administering disks are -
1. Format your disk
2. Partition a hard disk
3. Make a filesystem
4. Mount different filesystems to form a single tree structure

Linux, recognizes two different kinds of device:-
1. random-access block devices(disks) 
2. character devices (tapes or serial lines)

Each devices are represented by device files.so when we write or read form that device file, data goes to that device . example, sending data 
to printer file 
> cat filename > /dev/lp1   # contents of the file are printed

> ls -l /dev/ttyS0
	crw-rw-r--    1 root     dialout    4,  64 Aug 19 18:56 /dev/ttyS0

here first letter c represents character device .For ordinary files, the first character is `-'

----------------------- Hard disk ----
see diagram at  http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#HD-SCHEMATIC to understand how hard disk look like -

A hard disk consists of one or more circular aluminum platters\ , of which either or both surfaces are coated with a magnetic substance 
used for recording the data.	For each surface, there is a read-write head that examines or alters the recorded data. The platters 
rotate on a common axis; typical rotation speed is 5400 or 7200 rotations per minute

processor (CPU)  --->disk controller  ---->actual disk

The processor (CPU) and the actual disk communicate through a disk controller . This relieves the rest of the computer from knowing how 
to use the drive, since the controllers for different types of disks can be made to use the same interface towards the rest of the 
computer. Therefore, the computer can say just ``hey disk, give me what I want'', instead of a long and complex series of electric 
signals to move the head to the proper location and waiting for the correct position to come under the head and doing all the other 
unpleasant stuff necessary.

------------------------Storage Area Networks
A SAN is a dedicated storage network that provides block level access to LUNs. A LUN, or logical unit number, is a virtual disk provided
by the SAN.Two networking protocols commonly used in a SAN are fibre channel and iSCSI . A fibre channel network is very fast
iSCSI is a newer technology that sends SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network

------------------------Network Attached Storage
A NAS uses your companies existing Ethernet network to allow access to shared disks. This is filesystem level access. The system 
administrator does not have the ability to partition or format the disks since they are potentially shared by multiple computers. 
This technology is commonly used to provide multiple workstations access to the same data.

------------------------Formatting
Formatting is the process of writing marks on the magnetic media that are used to mark tracks and sectors. Before a disk is formatted, 
its magnetic surface is a complete mess of magnetic signals. When it is formatted, some order is brought into the chaos by essentially 
drawing lines where the tracks go, and where they are divided into sectors.
What is important is that a disk cannot be used unless it has been formatted. During formatting one might encounter bad spots on the 
disk, called bad blocks or bad sectors.
Floppies are formatted with fdformat .

------------------------Partitions
A hard disk can be divided into several partitions. Each partition functions as if it were a separate hard disk. The idea is that if 
you have one hard disk, and want to have, say, two operating systems on it, you can divide the disk into two partitions. Each operating 
system uses its partition as it wishes and doesn't touch the other ones. This way the two operating systems can co-exist peacefully on 
the same hard disk. Without partitions one would have to buy a hard disk for each operating system.


------------------------The MBR, boot sectors and partition table
Master boot record (MBR)- The information about how a hard disk has been partitioned is stored in its first sector

$ fdisk -l /dev/hda
	
	Disk /dev/hda: 15 heads, 57 sectors, 790 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 855 * 512 bytes
	
	   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/hda1           1       1      24   10231+  82  Linux swap
	/dev/hda2          25      25      48   10260   83  Linux native
	/dev/hda3          49      49     408  153900   83  Linux native
	/dev/hda4         409     409     790  163305    5  Extended
	/dev/hda5         409     409     744  143611+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda6         745     745     790   19636+  83  Linux native

------------------------Extended and logical partitions
Extended Partition allows partitioning a primary partition into sub-partitions. The primary partition thus subdivided is the extended 
partition; the sub-partitions are logical partitions. They behave like primary partitions, but are created differently. There is no 
speed difference between them. By using an extended partition you can now have up to 15 partitions per disk.

see figure 5.2 at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#DISK-USAGE


------------------------Partition types
The partition tables (the one in the MBR, and the ones for extended partitions) contain one byte per partition that identifies the type 
of that partition. The purpose is to make it possible to avoid having two operating systems accidentally using the same partition.

here are some of the partition types-
