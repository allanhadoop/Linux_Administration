When you install or upgrade your system, you need to do a fair amount of work on your disks. You have to make filesystems on your disks so
that files can be stored on them and reserve space for the different parts of your system

The basic tasks in administering disks are -
1. Format your disk
2. Partition a hard disk
3. Make a filesystem
4. Mount different filesystems to form a single tree structure

Linux, recognizes two different kinds of device:-
1. random-access block devices(disks) 
2. character devices (tapes or serial lines)

Each devices are represented by device files.so when we write or read form that device file, data goes to that device . example, sending data 
to printer file 
> cat filename > /dev/lp1   # contents of the file are printed

> ls -l /dev/ttyS0
	crw-rw-r--    1 root     dialout    4,  64 Aug 19 18:56 /dev/ttyS0

here first letter c represents character device .For ordinary files, the first character is `-'

## Hard disk ----
see diagram at  http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#HD-SCHEMATIC to understand how hard disk look like -

A hard disk consists of one or more circular aluminum platters\ , of which either or both surfaces are coated with a magnetic substance 
used for recording the data.	For each surface, there is a read-write head that examines or alters the recorded data. The platters 
rotate on a common axis; typical rotation speed is 5400 or 7200 rotations per minute

processor (CPU)  --->disk controller  ---->actual disk

The processor (CPU) and the actual disk communicate through a disk controller . This relieves the rest of the computer from knowing how 
to use the drive, since the controllers for different types of disks can be made to use the same interface towards the rest of the 
computer. Therefore, the computer can say just ``hey disk, give me what I want'', instead of a long and complex series of electric 
signals to move the head to the proper location and waiting for the correct position to come under the head and doing all the other 
unpleasant stuff necessary.
