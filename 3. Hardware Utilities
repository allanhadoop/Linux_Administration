1. The MAKEDEV Script
Most device files will already be created and will be there ready to use after you install your Linux system. If by some chance you need 
to create one which is not provided then you should first try to use the MAKEDEV script. This script is usually located in /dev/MAKEDEV
or /sbin/MAKEDEV

  # /dev/MAKEDEV -v ttyS0
	  create ttyS0   c 4 64 root:dialout 0660
  
# This will create the device file /dev/ttyS0 (ttyS0 is a serial port) with major node 4 and minor node 64 as a character device with 
access permissions 0660 with owner root and group dialout. Here 4 and 64 for numbers understood by Kernel.
  
The mknod command - This is used only when if we know minor and  major node.. else we will use MAKEDEV command. Example if we know 4 and 64
then perform below steps to create device

  # mknod /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64
	# chown root.dialout /dev/ttyS0
	# chmod 0644 /dev/ttyS0
	# ls -l /dev/ttyS0
		crw-rw----   1 root dialout    4,   64 Oct 23 18:23 /dev/ttyS0
