Linux = kernel + some system programs + application programs for doing work. 


Kernel - It keeps track of files on the disk, starts programs and runs them concurrently, assigns memory and other resources to various 
processes, receives packets from and sends packets to the network, and so on. The kernel does very little by itself, but it provides 
tools with which all services can be built

The system programs use the tools provided by the kernel to implement the various services required from an operating system. System 
programs, and all other programs, run `on top of the kernel', in what is called the user mode
A word processor is an application; mount is a system program.

1. Memory Management - Memory management takes care of assigning memory areas and swap space areas to processes, parts of the kernel, and 
for the buffer cache
2. Process Management - Process management creates processes, and implements multitasking by switching the active process on the processor.

3. Hardware device driver - the kernel contains a hardware device driver for each kind of hardware it supports. all disk drivers look 
alike to the rest of the kernel, i.e., they all have operations like `initialize the drive', `read sector N', and `write sector N'.

4. Virtual filesystem (VFS) layer - It abstracts the filesystem operations away from their implementation. Each filesystem type provides 
an implementation of each filesystem operation. When some entity tries to use a filesystem, the request goes via the VFS, which routes 
the request to the proper filesystem driver.

--- Major services in Linux system - 
1. init 
2. logins from terminal
3. Syslog
4. Periodic command execution: cron and at
5. Graphical user interface - GUI
6. Networking
7. Network logins
8. Network file systems - NFS
9. Mail
10. Printing
11. The filesystem layout

------------------------
1. init - init is started as the first process of every UNIX system, as the last thing the kernel does when it boots. When init starts, 
it continues the boot process by doing various startup chores (checking and mounting filesystems, starting daemons, etc).
